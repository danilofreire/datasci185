Here you will find information about the assignments for DATASCI 185. There are ten problem sets and five in-class quizzes, along with a final group project. The assignments are designed to help you practice the concepts covered in class and to develop your understanding of AI systems and their applications.

Assignment submissions are typically due on the week following their publication. You may submit via Canvas (preferred) or email (<danilo.freire@emory.edu>).

I encourage you to complete assignments in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), Word documents, or PDFs. The assignment folders contain the questions in various formats, so you can use them as templates.

## Assessment Overview

- **Problem sets (10) — 50%**. Short conceptual and practical tasks. Submit Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), Word documents, or PDFs. Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day unless authorised in advance. Collaboration for discussion is allowed but answers must be written independently; list collaborators on submission.  

- **In-class quizzes (5) — 30%**. Each quiz occupies a full lecture. Quizzes are open-book/open-notes and individual assessments. Discussion during quizzes is not permitted.  

- **Final group project — 20%**. Groups of 3–4 produce a report and a short demo video. The project involves conceptual elements and a harms assessment. More details will be provided in class.
