title: "DATASCI 185 - Introduction to AI Applications"
---

Welcome to [DATASCI 185](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci185)! This course offers a non-technical introduction to artificial intelligence and its effects on institutions, work and everyday life. The course is practical: students will learn how modern systems are designed and how to ask the right questions about data, reliability and harms. The course combines short demonstrations (no programming experience required), case studies, and project work. It is suitable for undergraduate students from any faculty who want a grounded understanding of what AI can and cannot do.

We will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 4:00pm to 4:50pm in the [Psychology Building, Room 290](https://maps.app.goo.gl/orrT4jaoxjYiojkL7). It is important to read the assigned readings before class, and make sure to check this website for updates and additional resources. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I am here to help you succeed in this course and beyond.
