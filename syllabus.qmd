Welcome to [DATASCI 185!](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci185) This course offers a non-technical introduction to artificial intelligence and its effects on institutions, work and everyday life. The course is practical: students will learn how modern systems are designed and how to ask the right questions about data, reliability and harms. The course combines short demonstrations (no programming experience required), case studies, and project work. It is suitable for undergraduate students from any faculty who want a grounded understanding of what AI can and cannot do.

# Course Information

We will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 4:00pm to 4:50pm in the [Psychology Building, Room 290](https://maps.app.goo.gl/orrT4jaoxjYiojkL7). The course will be a mix of lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities. Therefore, it is important that you read the assigned readings before class. Students are encouraged to participate and are most welcome to express their views openly and freely.

All information about the course will be available at <http://danilofreire.github.io/datasci185>. The syllabus will be updated periodically according to the progress of the class. Please remember to visit the website regularly.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Explain the main ideas behind contemporary AI systems in plain language.
- Identify common failure modes of AI systems and the data issues that cause them.
- Read and assess claims about AI in news articles, product pages and policy documents.
- Design a small, realistic plan for an AI application, including data needs, evaluation, and a basic harm-mitigation strategy.
- Reflect critically on ethical, legal and social questions raised by AI deployment.

# Prerequisites and Software

No formal prerequisites. Familiarity with spreadsheets, basic statistics or introductory programming is useful but not required. We will discuss some simple Python code snippets in class, but no programming experience is needed.

# Readings and Resources

Readings are short papers, essays and tutorials rather than a single textbook. Links and PDFs will be provided on the course website. Please note that the syllabus may be updated during the semester. For those interested in digging deeper into some of the topics we cover, here are some recommended books and resources:

# Assessments

- **Problem sets (10) — 50%**. Short conceptual and practical tasks. Submit Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), Word documents, or PDFs. Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day unless authorised in advance. Collaboration for discussion is allowed but answers must be written independently; list collaborators on submission.  

- **In-class quizzes (5) — 30%**. Each quiz occupies a full lecture. Quizzes are open-book/open-notes and individual assessments. Discussion during quizzes is not permitted.  

- **Final group project — 20%**. Groups of 3–4 produce a report and a short demo video. The project involves conceptual elements and a harms assessment. More details will be provided in class.

# Grading Scale

| Grade | A  | A- | B+ | B  | B- | C  | D  | F  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Range | 91–100 | 86–90 | 81–85 | 76–80 | 71–75 | 66–70 | 60–65 | <60 |

Final grades are rounded to the nearest point.

# Academic Integrity and AI Use

Generative AI tools (for example ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) may be used as aids for brainstorming or drafting, but all AI use must be declared on submissions. Students must take responsibility for correctness and must attribute any direct text or code produced by AI. The Emory Honour Code applies.

# Emory Honour Code

The Emory Undergraduate Academic Honour Code is in effect throughout the semester. The Honour Code applies to any action or inaction that fails to meet the communal expectations of academic integrity. Students should strive to excel in their academic pursuits in a just way with honesty and fairness in mind and avoid all instances of cheating, lying, plagiarizing, or engaging in other acts that violate the Honor Code. Such violations undermine both the individual pursuit of knowledge and the collective trust of the Emory community. Students who violate the Honour Code may be subject to failure of the course, a reportable record, suspension, permanent expulsion, or a combination of these and other sanctions. The Honor Code may be reviewed at: <http://catalog.college.emory.edu/academic/policies-regulations/honor-code.html>.

# Accessibility

Students who require adjustments should contact the Department of Accessibility Services early in the semester and provide documentation. Reasonable accommodations will be made for assessments, including quizzes, according to DAS guidance. Please contact me privately to discuss any specific needs.
